# Day 13

## Cloud Study
Another day, another Pluralsight session. Once again using the lab environment but this time with a focus on scalability and customisng rules to create a highly available scale set. Had a few issues with this one as the load balancer wasn't working at first, but was able to get the scale set spun up without it and then go back and add the load balancer afterwards. Definitely more comfortable with Azure as time goes on.
