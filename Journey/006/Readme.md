# Day 6

## Cloud Study
Another very short day but the progress is steady. I figured it's better to do a little bit every day rather than try to have a huge day once a week. Today I covered Application Gateway, Scale Sets, and started the App Service portion. Nearly done 7 days in a row so feeling quite pleased.
