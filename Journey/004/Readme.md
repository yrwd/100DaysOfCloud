# Day 3

## Cloud Study
Spent today going through the VM content for the AZ-104 exam. Spun up a couple of machines, got familiar with RDP and SSH, used Bastion as well but honestly not sure how much I took in! Been able to get through quite a big chunk of the course this weekend. Definitely helps doing this on consecutive days, just to keep it all fresh! 

Just about halfway through my first pass of the content now. Want to hopefully have it finished by the end of the week so I can take a practice test and see which areas I need to go back over!
