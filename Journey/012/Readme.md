# Day 12

## Cloud Study
Haven't written down any of my progress for the last two weeks. Just really been going back over the course content again and started to sit the Whizlabs practice tests. I've noticed the actual course content is sitting well with me, but my weakest area is actually detailing the steps out in the test questions. It's one thing to do it when you're sat in front of the portal with google on your second monitor, but completely different in the test environment. I'm using Pluralsight's labs to improve at this, and they're very beneficial. Will try to post a bit more regularly now that I'm doing meatier labs rather than just revision days!
