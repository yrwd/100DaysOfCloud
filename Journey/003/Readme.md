# Day 3

## Cloud Study
Much better day today, covered the whole policy section needed for the AZ-104, the whole ARM and ARM Template sections, and most of the storage account section. 

Tried playing around with using AZCopy to copy files to storage accounts and had tonne of issues getting it to run. Didn’t seem to like any of the access roles I had on my personal account, eventually gave up and tried using my work account and voila it worked. Went back and used my personal account and that worked too. Turns out I’m just very impatient and didn’t wait long enough to let the roles get set up properly! 

Will hopefully get some experience with creating a File Share tomorrow, and setting up Files Sync!
