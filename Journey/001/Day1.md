# Day 1 - Pre-planning

## Introduction

After ~~scrolling through reddit and twitter~~ doing some research, I'm going to make the focus of this 100DaysOfCloud challenge getting myself to the point where I'm ready to take the AZ-104 exam. Hopefully getting some exposure to the wider cloud community and actually understanding what's going on! If as time goes on my knowledge increases enough that I end up with a side project, I will also document my progress.


## Cloud Study

So at this point, I'm essentially launching into the tough stuff of AZ-104. I completed the AZ-900 last month so I've been able to blast through the prerequisites on MS Learn. I'm also supplementing the MS Learn documentation with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PbGbTUSAg from freeCodeCamp.org which is brilliant.



## Next Steps

I'm finding the video I mentioned above really well-paced and I am really getting through the content faster and easier than by just using the MS Learn documentation. So I may start off by finishing the freeCodeCamp.org video, and then going through MS Learn to do the reading, and then the labs/knowledge tests.
