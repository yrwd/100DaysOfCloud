# Day 2

## Cloud Study

Covered Azure AD vs AAD, Tenants, AD Domain Services, AD Connect, Users/Groups/Policies etc. Also covered the AD Device Management, such as MDM, Enterprise Mobility & Security etc.

Not too much to log today, a lot of this stuff is simply just learning what the different services can do and how to use them. Quite similar to the AZ-900 in that regard, so very pleased with the level of complexity at this stage. Not a fantasticly productive day, but figured I would start to make logging my progress a habit. 

Planning to get some more serious work done over the weekend!
