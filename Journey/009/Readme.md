# Day 9

## Cloud Study
Took a break from logging my progress for a couple of days. Still did a few bits though, I've now done my first run through of the ExamPro AZ-104 video guide. Really good introduction to the material. Now I'm going through the Pluralsight material to firm up the areas I'm not as confident with. Primariliy the AD identity stuff, the virtual netwroking, and the Azure compute rules. Also definitely going to take a Powershell course on Pluralsight very soon!
